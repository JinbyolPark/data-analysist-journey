### Learning Python with ChatGPT

I prefer learning in three steps:

1. **Follow** — Start by simply following someone else's code or idea.
2. **Understand** — Break down each step to deeply understand what’s happening.
3. **Expand** — Build on top of that understanding and make it my own.

This repository documents my learning journey, day by day.
